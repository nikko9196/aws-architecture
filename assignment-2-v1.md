  - Public subnets but protected by AWS Network Firewall where AWS ALB and NATGW sit `Protected Tier`.
  - Private subnets `Multi-Purpose Tier` where different EC2 workloads called `services/microservices` are managed by AutoScalingGroup, load balanced by ALB from the tier above.
  - Private subnets `Secure Tier` where RDS, EFS and other AWS Managed databases reside
  - Private subbets `Management Tier` where few EC2 jump host are available only for the AWS Manager - Session Manager to use and only access RDS in the `Secure Tier`. No other hoops are allowed.
- All traffic coming into the VPC must be inspected by the AWS Network Firewall service
- All traffic going out to the public internet must be inspected by AWS Network Firewall service as well

Hint: don't forget the the Container Registry component

# Part III. AWS Native Architecture design (10 marks total)

Research, design, draw figures. 

Design exercise requirements:
- The client wishes to build a news aggregator web app to earn money with Google Ads
  - The backend constantly look for latest news from many different news websites. Some sites require refreshing data every 10 seconds, some sites less frequently
  - Save the aggregated news headline and links into a no management database with infinite scale
  - The backend should use a no management APIGW to allow for the static website to make API calls to
- The website should be ideally 
  - Very cheap to host, and 
  - Deployed to a globally available CDN 
  - Completely billed by on-demand pricing models
  - Has no management effort required, except for incident resolution
- Both the APIGW and the static website have domain name
  - Static website has CNAME `www.` points to `bestnewsaggregator.com`
  - APIGW has domain record `api.`
  - The APIGW should be protected against Layer 7 attacks such as SQL injection, or DDOS protection
  - Both needs to be secured by SSL certificate from a publically trusted CA
- The backend should be consisted of:
  - `GET /news API` to get the latest news from the static website. It may look at geolocation, device, and browser information to customize the news resource
  - `GET /news API` response should also be cached to save infrastructure cost
  - Only the Origin `www.` should be able to make request to `api.` (CORS)
  - A scheduler component that trigger scalable backend job to fetch for lastest news articles
  - Fetched links need to be checked if they are actually new according to the internal database with infinite scale mentioned earlier
  - The combination infrastructure of scheduling + fan-out scheduling event to the list of new source + get news executor should be fast, management free, and scalable
  - Some news sources are only updated once daily while others are known to have new articles to be released at any given moment. Thus, the design should be able to trigger news source aggregators tailored for individual websites at a different rate, depending on the frequency settings of each of the crawled websites. Note that there are thousands of websites thus the chosen scheduling setup should be scalable to reduce overheads on the engineers to add more sources.

As the lead engineer, you are tasked with designing this architecture to fulfill all of the customer requirements using AWS Cloud.

Expected submission formats are:
- Produce your architecture design into graphics files `.drawio` or exported `.png` in high resolution
- Make short notes on the AWS Components on how some of the requirements are fulfilled
- It is encourged to reference to `.png` images inside file `Part III/Answer.md`

You should be able to design the architecture with only AWS services (don't have to use all of these) such as:
- EventBridge scheduler
- SNS
- SQS
- S3
- CloudFront
- APIGW
- WAF
- Route53
- ACM
- DynamoDB
- Lambda
- StepFunction
- EventBridge

## Part IV.1. Setup source events (10/30 marks)
1. User uploads a high resolution `.jpg` image into the AWS Console into a S3 bucket (you are free to choose the Bucket name), under folder `uploads/`.
2. S3 has been configured to send events to EventBridge. This is your default event bus (all AWS accounts have one). 
3. Setup an EventBridge rule to only listen for files inserted into the `uploads/` folder, suffix file extension is `.jpg` and S3 objects that have been Created.
4. Custom code in a `Lambda function: process-image-function` picks up the events, and resize the image into maximum width of 200 pixels, while keeping the same images ratio (and leave same if the image size is too small). 

## Part IV.2. Checking in (10/30 marks)

5. Custom code in a `Lambda function: process-image-function` saves this image to a different S3 bucket of your own choosing, under folder `processed/`.
6. Custom code in a `Lambda function: process-image-function` , EventBridge events are sent to custom domain event bus in EventBridge `EventBridge bus: image-processing-bus`. 
7. If the image resizing process and S3 save process completed without error, send an event with `"status": "SUCCEEDED"` to EventBridge bus `EventBridge bus: image-processing-bus`. Additionally, add a publicly shareable S3 presigned URL of them resized image from the new S3 bucket under folder `processed/`. Send this information together with the EventBridge success event.
8. If the image resizing process or S3 save process failed (try except will be needed), send an event with `"status": "FAILED"` to EventBridge bus `EventBridge bus: image-processing-bus`

## Part IV.3. Making a claim (10/30 marks)

9.  If the EventBridge event typed `"status": "SUCCEEDED"` is sent to EventBridge bus `EventBridge bus: image-processing-bus`, a rule will pick up and send to `Lambda function: notify-resize-success-function` to print out logs `"SUCCEEDED"` and the S3 presigned url path. You can pick this url and test with your browser. 
10.  If the EventBridge event typed `"status":"FAILED"` is sent to EventBridge bus `EventBridge bus: image-processing-bus`, a rule will pick up and send to `Lambda function : notify-resize-fail-function`. This Lambda function can simply logs out `"FAILED"`.

## Part IV.4. Bonus mark for quality (5 bonus mark)

Bonus given for:
- Clean code
- Implementation broken down into modules
- Unit testing with mock S3/EventBridge dependencies
- Python script that makes use of Python SDK to generate test event by uploading to S3 programmatically, or producing mock events to EventBridge
- Figuring out on how to do local development for S3 local/or localstack
